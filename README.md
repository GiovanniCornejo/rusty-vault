# RustyVault

A secure command-line password manager implemented in Rust.

## Project Roadmap

This section provides an overview of planned features, ongoing tasks, and future enhancements for the project.

### Current Tasks

- [x] Set up project repository
- [ ] Design data model for password entries
- [ ] Choose encryption mechanism
- [ ] Implement command-line interface (CLI)
- [ ] Develop password encryption and storage functionality
- [ ] Write tests for encryption and decryption
- [ ] Implement error handling and input validation

### Planned Features

- [ ] Add password generation functionality
- [ ] Implement password strength analysis
- [ ] Integrate with external password managers (e.g., LastPass, Bitwarden)
- [ ] Enhance usability with interactive prompts and user-friendly messaging

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] Implement support for storing additional metadata (e.g., website URLs, account names)
- [ ] Add support for importing and exporting password data
- [ ] Implement secure password sharing between trusted users
- [ ] Explore options for multi-device synchronization and backup

## Goal

### Motivation

RustyVault is a project aimed at expanding my skills in Rust programming and exploring best practices in software development. While the primary goal is to create a secure command-line password manager, the project also serves as a learning opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of Rust and cryptography.

### Contributing Code

At this time, no contributions are being accepted for RustyVault. The project is primarily for educational purposes, and I am focusing on developing and refining the codebase independently. The contribution policy may change in the future as the project evolves.

### Educational Purposes

Please note that RustyVault is primarily a learning project and may not be suitable for production use. While every effort is made to ensure the security and reliability of the code, it's important to exercise caution when handling sensitive information. By contributing to this project, you acknowledge that your participation is for educational purposes and that the project is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.
